# breakout_ball

This code is a Java implementation of the popular game "Breakout". The game is played on a panel with a ball, a paddle, and bricks. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks by hitting them with the ball using the paddle, without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen. The player controls the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.

The game mechanics are implemented in the Breakout class, which extends the JPanel class. The ball, paddle, and bricks are represented by Rectangle objects. The play() method is the main game loop that updates the position of the ball, checks for collisions, and repaints the panel. The checkCollisions() method handles collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks.

The initializeBricks() method initializes the bricks on the panel in a grid formation. The paintComponent() method is responsible for painting the game elements on the panel. The main() method creates a JFrame object, adds the Breakout panel to it, and starts the game loop using the play() method.
